# Technical notes

The macOS side was measured on **FM27, Steam build 26340721, Apple silicon** (game_plugin LC_UUID
`F4540355-2186-39CB-9119-C706A6A35346`) and checked against a real save and the running game. The Windows side
uses the same build's layout as published by FMLibreEditor and was live-tested by this project on 8 November 2026
(Steam build 26340721, `game_plugin.dll` `PE-6AE565AF-1821C000`, an Ajax save): club, squad, date and calendar
read correctly, and budgets, morale, injuries, a training day and a sale were each written and undone.

## Architecture

```
macOS
FM27 Trainer.app ──(Unix socket: one JSON line per request)──▶ libfm27_agent.dylib inside FM27
   │  egui UI, OCR, planner                                      │  RTTI lookup, mach_vm_read/write
   └─ starts FM27 with DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES ────────────────────┘  writes only after a check + undo log

Windows
FM27 Trainer.exe ── same agent code, linked in ──▶ fm.exe (ReadProcessMemory / WriteProcessMemory)
```

The agent crate (`agent/`) holds the game logic for both: `mem.rs` (memory access per platform, plus a
simulated memory for tests), `rtti.rs` (Itanium and MSVC RTTI) and `game.rs` (layouts, builds, commands).

- FM27 on macOS is signed with `com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables` and
  `disable-library-validation`, so a library can be loaded at launch with SIP enabled. An external reader would
  need `task_for_pid`, which the game does not allow.
- The app launches `fm.app/Contents/MacOS/Football Manager 27` directly with `SteamAppId=4530370`, so Steam does
  not relaunch it without the library.
- The agent finds classes by Itanium RTTI: an object starts with its vtable pointer, `[vtable-8]` is the
  type_info, `[type_info+8]` the mangled name (`N2db16HUMAN_NON_PLAYERE`).
- Writes go through `mach_vm_write` and only happen when the bytes still equal what the agent read. Every write
  is logged for undo. On an unknown `game_plugin` UUID the agent refuses to write.

## Windows

- The app opens `fm.exe` with `PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_VM_WRITE | PROCESS_VM_OPERATION |
  PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION`; FM can be started from Steam as usual. The native core is `game_plugin.dll`; a build
  is identified by its PE link timestamp and SizeOfImage (`PE-6AE565AF-1821C000` for Steam 26340721,
  `PE-6AE563A1-175DA000` for Game Pass / Xbox app 0.9.2409.0). The Game Pass build is the same November update
  (linked 526 s earlier) with the same object layout; only the statics moved (staff `0x5683E08`, clubs
  `0x5683F78`, date `0x56257C8`, from FMLibreEditor's `gamepass-0.9.2409.0.toml`). Its process is `fm.exe` too,
  run from the package's `Content` folder, and opens with the same rights.
- The human manager is found in the game's staff array (the `(begin, end)` pair at RVA `0x5705818`), with MSVC
  RTTI as a fallback: `[vtable-8]` is the Complete Object Locator, whose TypeDescriptor holds
  `.?AVHUMAN_NON_PLAYER@db@@`. The in-game date is at RVA `0x56AF378`.
- Players and staff are laid out differently by MSVC (a vbptr, and the identity block before the person):

| Field | macOS | Windows |
|---|---|---|
| Human manager contract / identity (+ `0x340`) | `0x170` / `0x208` | `0x1A8` / `0x100` |
| Player team, injury record | `0x128`, `0xF0` | `0x130`, `0xF8` |
| Player sharpness, condition, morale | `0x250`, `0x254`, `0x264` | `0x258`, `0x25C`, `0x26C` |
| Player names (first, last, common) | `0x298`, `0x2A0`, `0x2A8` | `0x2D8`, `0x2E0`, `0x2E8` |
| Player contract, identity, UID | `0x2F0`, `0x388`, `0x394` | `0x330`, `0x288`, `0x294` |

  Clubs, finances, contracts, teams, injuries and bans are the same on both. The training calendar block holds
  its week list at `+0x28` from the team pointer on Windows too (measured live); the agent still tries nearby
  offsets as a fallback, accepting a list only when every week has a valid date, ascending Mondays and valid
  session codes.
- Finding the calendar: every heap word that equals the team pointer is a candidate, with no cap (a fresh
  Sunderland save had 2,042 of them and the calendar was number 1,462; a big club deep into a save has many
  more). A week is accepted when its Monday is a valid date, the first word of each day block is small (0 in
  every save seen; never written) and at least two thirds of the 21 slots hold known codes (≤ 600), five of them
  non-zero. `set_week` leaves a day with an unknown code alone. When nothing is found, the error lists how many
  candidates were seen and why near misses were rejected.
- `game_plugin.dll` is packed: its sections are named `.xtext`, `.data1`, `.shared`, `.rodata`, `.sbss` (307 MB,
  filled while loading), `.rdata` (small) and so on, not the usual `.text`/`.data`/`.rdata`. The protector
  renames them per build: on Game Pass 0.9.2409.0 the TypeDescriptors are in `.00cfg`, the vtables in `.trace`
  and the big read-write-execute section is called `.rsrc`. The MSVC RTTI lookup (TypeDescriptors, Complete
  Object Locators, vtables) therefore scans every section, whatever its name (the whole image if the section
  table cannot be read); a locator checks itself by its own RVA, so an extra section only costs time (a class
  lookup takes about 1.1 s). A chunk that cannot be read in one go is retried in smaller pieces.
  Finding a class this way takes about 1.5 s once (the vtables are cached), and a full scan of FM's heap (3.5 GB)
  through `ReadProcessMemory` about 1.5 s in a release build. An unoptimised build is some 40 times slower, so
  the workspace builds the agent crate with `opt-level = 3` in the dev profile as well.
- `agent/src/tests.rs` runs every command (club, squad, budgets, heal, bans, morale, training, undo) against a
  simulated FM for both layouts, and the MSVC RTTI code against `agent/testdata/rtti_test.dll`, a small MSVC-ABI
  DLL built with clang and lld.

## Memory layout (macOS)

| Chain | Offsets |
|---|---|
| Human manager | class `db::HUMAN_NON_PLAYER`; person block shifted `0x340`; contract `+0x4B0`; contract owner `+0x08` = manager `+0x548` |
| Contract → team → club | team `contract+0x10`, club `team+0x30`, club UID `club+0x0C`, name `club+0xC0` |
| Finances | `club+0x150` → balance `+0x0C`, transfer budget `+0x7C4`, total wage `+0x808`, wage budget `+0x814` (i32, pounds) |
| Squad | `team+0x38` = list (begin, end, cap) of player objects |
| Player | morale `+0x264` (u8, 1–20), condition `+0x254`, sharpness `+0x250`, injury record `+0xF0`, contract `+0x2F0`, UID `+0x394`, names `+0x298/+0x2A0/+0x2A8` (player-coaches shift person fields by `+0xF8`) |
| Tactical understanding | player `+0x100` on Windows (`+0xF8` expected on macOS, unverified) → a 0xE0-byte record, see below |
| Injuries | injury record starts with a list of current injuries; the game heals by setting `end = begin`; absences (bans have `0xFFFF` at `+0x16`) at record `+0x18` |
| Happiness | contract `+0x5A` (i16), reasons-to-be-unhappy pointer at contract `+0x30` |
| In-game date | `team+0xA0` → `+0x94`: u16 day-of-year (low 9 bits) + u16 year |
| Training calendar | a per-team block in the training manager holds the team pointer; `+0x28` is a list of week records (`0x60` bytes): `+0x0C` Monday's date, `+0x10` 7 day blocks of `[u16 0, session1, session2, extra]` |

Player, contract, club and finance offsets match the public layout files of FMLibreEditor and FMSuperScout;
the training calendar and in-game date path were measured for this project.

## Tactical understanding

FM27's *Tactical Understanding* (the successor of tactical familiarity) is stored per player. The layout was
found by disassembling FM's own in-game editor action `TEAM_MAXIMISE_TACTICAL_UNDERSTANDING_ACTION` in the running
`game_plugin.dll` (Windows, 8 November 2026; see `agent/src/understanding.rs`). The player points (Windows `+0x100`)
to a 0xE0-byte record:

| Offset | Content |
|---|---|
| `+0x00`–`+0xBF` | six 0x20-byte blocks, one per area (0 Passing Style, 1 Build Up, 2 Chance Creation, 3 In Possession Shape, 4 Line of Engagement, 5 Pressing Intensity): a (begin, end, cap) list of `u32` items and the area number at `+0x18`. Item: bits 0–13 the level (0–10000), bits 14–19 the tactic setting (0–20, 10 = balanced), the rest unused. At most 20 items. |
| `+0xC0` | a (begin, end, cap) list of 16-byte items for Pressing Trap and Out Of Possession Shape: `u16` role/position code (bit 13 tells the two areas apart), 11 bytes describing the shape, a flag byte, and the level (`u16`) at `+0x0E` |
| `+0xD8` | a date; `+0xDC` a byte FM sets to 1 after a change |

A player's understanding of a setting is the highest item level minus 1000 per step of distance to that setting,
with a floor of 1000 (10 %). FM's "maximise" adds 10000 to the items of the manager's tactics and clamps at 10000.
The app sets every existing item to 10000 and adds the setting most players know for anyone who lacks it, but
only while FM's list has capacity left (the game's allocator cannot be called from outside); players without a
record (never trained with the team) are skipped. Live-tested on Windows (Ajax save, 27 players).

## Session codes

| Range | Category | Codes |
|---|---|---|
| 0–7 | Tactical Understanding | Passing Style, Build Up, Chance Creation, In Possession Shape, Line of Engagement, Pressing Intensity, Pressing Trap, Out Of Possession Shape |
| 100–108 | Match Preparation | Press Avoidance, Ball Progression, Final Third, Defensive Block, Defensive Positioning, Defensive Engagement, Corners, Free Kicks, Penalties |
| 200–228 | Footballing Development | Individual Development, Attacking/Defensive/Possession Ball Work, … |
| 300–307 | Physical & Recovery | Rest, Recovery, Light Conditioning, Conditioning, Heavy Conditioning, … |
| 400–402 | Extra-Curricular | Team Bonding, Community Outreach, Travel |
| 500 | Match | Match |

The order follows `training/training_sessions` in FM27's game data and was confirmed against the calendar
in a save (for example day `[200, 3, 7]` = Individual Development / In Possession Shape / Out Of Possession Shape).

## FM data files

- `.fmf` is an SI archive. `02 01 "afe."` files hold records of `u32 16, u32 16, key[16], IV[16]`, then
  AES-128-CTR over a zstd frame (the key is in the file). `02 01 "fmf."` files are the same without encryption,
  and FM accepts both. A zstd manifest after the footer lists name, extension, offset (from byte 26), stored
  size, raw size and two timestamps. See `tools/fmf_unpack.py`.
- `game_plugin.bundle/…/game_simulation/training.fmf` contains `training_sessions.jsb` (59 sessions),
  `training_session_categories.jsb` and `training_schedule_templates.jsb` (99 presets).
- `.jsb` is SI's binary JSON: the low nibble of each type byte is the type (`a` object, `9` array, `8` string,
  `2` int, `1` bool), and the high nibble is an inline count/length/value plus one, or 0 when a u32 follows. Inline
  ints are `n - 8`. See `tools/jsb.py`.

## Screen reading

Reading is independent of the screen size and FM's UI scale: the capture is analysed at its own size and, when
the key-factor labels are not about 20 px high (the size of 2560×1440 at 100 %), again on a copy scaled to that
size; the result at the reference size wins on a tie. Labels are matched tolerantly (one letter per six may be
misread), a label the OCR missed gets its row from the row pitch and the pie column of the labels that were
found, and a column without any label is anchored on its "Key Factors" header (first row 2.15 header heights
below it, the pie being the last round blob on the row). The component bars are read as brightness peaks (the
ticks), with the frame border excluded, and the level is the coloured tick's position between the first and
last tick. Tested by downscaling a 2560×1440 capture to 1366×768 and upscaling it to 4K: all 21 values identical.

The Breakdown pies have 10 segments and fill clockwise from 12 o'clock; the empty segments are near-white
(measured on Windows, 8 November 2026) and the spokes between segments are light too. Each pie is first resampled
to 72 px (on a 1366×768 screen a pie is only 12–18 px across, which left many sectors without a single pixel and
made gauges disappear or read 0) and then measured in 36 angular sectors: the last sector that is really coloured gives the filled share, which is the score (4 of 10
segments = 40). Since 9 November 2026:
- A pie is cut out as the run of rows around its label's centre, so a gauge above or below that falls inside the
  search band (larger text in FM, tighter rows) is no longer measured with it; a cut-out that is far from round
  is rejected. Before this, a text-to-row ratio of 0.7 or more read 7 segments as 80 or 50 (synthetic test
  `pies_in_tight_rows`, now correct up to 1.1).
- Only pixels in the pie's own fill colour count as filled: the fill hue is the most common hue in the inner
  ring (no background mixes in there), and pixels more than 25° away from it count as not filled.
- FM paints a gauge by level: 20–40 % orange (~43°), 50–70 % yellow (~60°), 90 % green (~120°); 40 % was yellow
  on the Ajax save. A reading outside the band of its colour (orange above 50 %, yellow below 30 % or above 90 %,
  green below 70 %) is clamped to that band and flagged; the app asks the user to check flagged gauges.

Candidate pies are found by their coloured and near-white pixels, with the older mid-grey look as a fallback,
because the lighter background of a highlighted row would otherwise pass for an empty gauge. The
component bars have 11 slots with one coloured marker (the level) and one white marker; the level is the
marker's slot counted from the first tick (slot 7 of 11 = 60). The translucent panel background can drown the
ticks on one side, so the count of 11 is assumed when the chain of ticks is incomplete. A capture is saved as
`last-capture.png` (and `last-breakdown.png` when it held a Breakdown) in the app's data folder, so a wrong
reading can be replayed with `fm27-trainer analyze <png> --ocr`.

## Testing hooks

`FM27_PAGE=training|planning|club|squad|settings`, `FM27_LANG=nl|en`, and `FM27_SNAPSHOT=out.png` (the app
saves a screenshot of its own window and quits, which works even when FM is full screen). The CLI has
`fm27-trainer analyze <png> [--save]`, `train [--write]`, `agent '<json>'` and `start-fm`.
